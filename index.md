Hi there! Understand animals is all about studying and improving the lives of non-human animals. Hire me for research, software development, hardware design + manufacturing, and any other related work that might help out animals now or in the future.

I am also open to doing research and engineering work to help humans. Do get in touch if you have a project in mind. I just mostly focus on non-human animals because I think they are more neglected.
