Hi there! I am [Amanda Matthes](https://amanda-matthes.github.io/), a researcher and and engineer trying to help as many animals as I can.

I am currently finishing a PhD in computer science at the University of Oxford and I work as an engineer in Sheffield. I started understand animals to work on animal-focused side projects in my extra time without being held back by the financial and bureaucratic overheads of universities.
